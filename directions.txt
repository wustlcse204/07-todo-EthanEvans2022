Style Requirements

    ToDos should be separated from each other somehow

Functionality Requirements

    Adding a new ToDo can be done by pressing enter or clicking a button
    After adding a ToDo, the input area for new ToDos should become blank

Data Requirements

When page loads, existing ToDos are loaded from the server
When new ToDo is added, send it to the server
When a ToDo is "checked off" or deleted, send that to the server
